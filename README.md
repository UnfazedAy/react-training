# React Training Repository

Welcome to my **React Training Repository** — a collection of projects and exercises documenting my journey in learning and mastering **React.js**.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as my **learning log** as I dive deep into React. Each folder in this repo represents a focused exploration of a specific concept, pattern, or small project built using React.

Whether it's working with hooks, context, reducers, routing, or external APIs — each subfolder is a step forward in my React development path.

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

Below is a brief description of what each subfolder represents:

- **`context-api/`** – Practicing global state management using React Context API.
- **`context-reducer/`** – Combining Context API with `useReducer` for scalable state handling.
- **`edaman-api-tryout/`** – Experimenting with API calls (likely using the Edamam Recipe API).
- **`effect/`** – Exploring the `useEffect` hook and its dependencies.
- **`hooks/`** – A general playground for learning different React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.).
- **`language-card/`** – Possibly a UI component or project involving language display/styling cards.
- **`learn-state/`** – Focused practice on `useState` and state-driven UI updates.
- **`my-app/`** – Could be a starter project (e.g., from Create React App or Vite) used to test multiple ideas.
- **`oak-recipe/`** – A recipe-based mini app, possibly involving component structure, props, and state.
- **`routing/`** – Practicing with **React Router** for navigation and dynamic routes.
- **`shopping-list/`** – A simple CRUD-style app for managing a shopping list.
- **`use-reducer/`** – Understanding and applying the `useReducer` hook for complex state logic.
- **`users/`** – Likely a user listing or profile-based app, perhaps involving API fetching or routing.

> 🧪 Each folder is treated as a self-contained project and can be run independently.

## 🚀 How to Use

Each folder typically has its own:

- `package.json`
- `src/` directory
- And can be run using:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # or npm start (depending on the setup)
```
